# Bubble sort
This is an algorithm to implement the bubble sort in ruby.

## Description
The objective of this exercise is to learn about sorting algorithms by coding a bubble sort algorithm using Ruby.
We coded two methods to sort arrays with bubble sort algorithm. The first method takes an array as arguments and returns a sorted array. The seconde one sorts an array by accepting a block using the "yeild" keyword.
